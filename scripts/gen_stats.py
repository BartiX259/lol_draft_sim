content = "I'm making a League of Legends teamfight simulator and need accurate in-game numbers. I will send a champion file, where the stats may need to be updated. Assume the champion has two items, boots, is level 13, has maxed basic abilities, and has two points in their ultimate. The simulator only supports simple damage calculations, so adjust for factors like crit chance and penetration by increasing the damage appropriately. Maybe even account for an item's special ability by increasing the abilities' damage or the champion's attributes etc. Ensure every relevant stat is updated, including obvious ones like movement speed (ms), projectile speed, and hitbox size, as well as less obvious ones like ability tick rate, number of ticks or duration. Provide a breakdown of your item choices and all calculations involved and then replace all values in the provided champion file with the ones you calculated. Do not modify the file's structure or add new valuesâ€”only update existing ones. Don't add any comments either."
